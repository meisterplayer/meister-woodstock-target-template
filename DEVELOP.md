# Develop Meister plugins #

## Who is this for ##

If you want to work on the Meister core, exisiting core/optional plugins or create your own plugin

## Prerequisites ##

For now we assume you are using a Mac of Linux machine. Using Windows to compile works but we haven't tested it ourselves.
Furthermore you'd need;

-  Node installed. The meisterplayer team uses v6.9.4 at the time of writing, other versions probably work but your mileage may vary.
-  NPM installed. 
-  Reasonable understanding of ES6
  
## Developing and/or maintaining Meisterplayer Plugins ##


### TL;DR ###
To Setup the woodstock edition and it's plugins you can copy-paste the following GIST in a terminal:

[See GIST](https://gist.github.com/buttonfreak/72a069e977b8187b56f87e5337eee2ec)

### How does this work? ###
If you're gearing up for some Meisterplayer plugin development you should use this project as main task runner. If all the plugins you need are imported and configured you technically only would need to keep this project open in a terminal to run `npm start` and monitor the output once in a while. The actual coding is done from one or more plugin-directory you usually cloned from GitHub and a are linked into this project. 

Our ideal workflow (assuming this project is configured) is to open all plugins and Meister-core in Visual Studio Code, open the terminal in VSC and cd to this project, run `npm start` and get to work :-)

### Start setting up ###

##### Clone Meister from Github #####

To get started working on existing plugins you need to clone those plugins and the meister-core from GitHub and store these file *outside* the target-template (if you have cloned the template already).

- create a meister directory dedicated to the plugins and Meister core ;

```
mkdir meister && cd meister
```

- Clone Meister-core and core plugins;

```
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/meisterplayer.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/media-basemedia.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/player-html5player.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/ui-standardui.git
```

- Clone any other plugins you might want to use, check out the meisterplayer-repo's on github;

```
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/parser-multisource.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/media-nativehls.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/media-hls.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/media-dash.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/media-smooth.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/parser-webvtt.git
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/ui-debugoverlay.git 
```

##### Install plugin-dependencies ######

In each plugin and in Meisterplayer-core you need to run `npm install`. This could take a while.

##### Clone target template #####

Next up; clone the target-template from GitHub if you haven't already

```
git clone https://github.com/meisterplayer/meister-target-template.git && cd meister-target-template
```

Next; install dependencies by running `npm install`. This will also install all Meister-plugins though we don't need all of them directly, if you like to work on one or more plugins you should use `npm link` for that particular plugin. Using `npm link` NPM will symlink the source directory into the node-modules-folder, effectively removing the node_module installed by `npm install`. 
So, let's say you want to work on `media-nativehls` you would have to enter;:

``` 
npm link ../meister/media-nativehls 
``` 

*Change the path to reflect your folder-structure*, you can use both relative and absolute paths. If you link all plugins be prepared to have NPM slow down significantly, the filetree of the project will become quite large.

##### The index, src/meisterplayer-file and importing the correct source-files #####

`index.js` is the npm-main file, it merely imports `src/meisterplayer.js` which contains the collection of plugins that are imported and compiled by WebPack. If you linked a plugin into the project webpack will only compile it's `src` directory if you import the index of the plugin like this;

```
import NativeHls from '@npm-wearetriple/meister-plugin-nativehls/index';
```

If you want to import the dist-file (created when you use `npm run dist` from the plugin) from the linked plugin you should remove the reference to `index` like this;

```
import NativeHls from '@npm-wearetriple/meister-plugin-nativehls';
```

Webpack will also supply a webserver with hot-reloading, but please note that hot-reloading will only work if you reference the index-file of the plugin. 

*You should now be ready to start working on plugins development*

### Update after switching branches ###

If you checkout a branch of a plugin that has new dependencies you should update the node-modules. This can be done by cd'ing to the plugin-directory (the target of the NPM-link) and enter `npm update` . The package list should be updated to reflect the changes in dependencies. 


## NPM Tasks ##

`npm start`
Starts a browserSync server and hot-reloading 

`npm run build` 
Transpiles a non minified version using webpack

`npm run build:dist`
Transpiles and minifies a version using webpack

`npm run min`
Transpiles and minifies a version using webpack and puts it in /dist

`npm run jsdocs`
Creates API docs using JSDoc

`npm run bump`
Bumps version

`npm run changelog`
Creates a changelogs from transactional git logs


## Problems? ##
_I don't have hot-reloading when I save something in `plugin-xx`_

Check whether you have linked `plugin-xx` into the template project and you import the `index` of the plugin.


### Todo
Create and configure test-tasks
